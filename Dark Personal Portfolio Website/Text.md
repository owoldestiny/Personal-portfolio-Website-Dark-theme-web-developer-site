My
Biography

My name is John Cahn, I am a freelance website developer from Virginia, USA. I have years of experience creating websites for large and small companies. I have once worked with a company, after a few years of experience, I become a freelancer so that I will have the time to do other important things in my life.

When it comes to designing a website, I am pretty much confident in bringing your ideas to life. I design websites with software like adobe xd, sketch, and Figma.

Being a javascript lover, I prefer using node js for the backend, which also helps me code faster.
